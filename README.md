# AWS Lambda to Azure Functions Migration

This repository demonstrates a successful migration from **AWS Lambda** to **Azure Functions** using **GitHub Copilot's custom chat modes** for automated assistance throughout the migration process.

## 🚀 Project Overview

This serverless face-blurring application was originally built on AWS Lambda and has been completely migrated to Azure Functions, showcasing modern cloud-native patterns and security best practices.

### Original AWS Architecture → Azure Architecture

| AWS Service | Azure Equivalent | Migration Notes |
|-------------|------------------|-----------------|
| AWS Lambda | Azure Functions (FlexConsumption) | Event-driven serverless compute |
| Amazon S3 | Azure Blob Storage | Object storage for images |
| Amazon SQS | Azure Storage Queues | Message queuing for decoupled processing |
| Amazon EventBridge | Azure Event Grid | Event routing and triggers |
| AWS IAM Roles | Azure Managed Identity | Secure service-to-service authentication |
| CloudWatch | Azure Application Insights | Monitoring and logging |

## 🤖 Migration Process with GitHub Copilot

This migration was completed using **GitHub Copilot's custom chat modes**, specifically the **Lambda to Functions Migration** chat mode, which provided:

### Key Migration Assistance
- ✅ **Automated Assessment** - Analysis of existing AWS Lambda functions and dependencies
- ✅ **Code Migration** - Conversion from AWS Lambda handlers to Azure Functions v4 programming model
- ✅ **Infrastructure Translation** - AWS CloudFormation/SAM to Azure Bicep templates
- ✅ **Security Enhancement** - Implementation of managed identity authentication
- ✅ **Best Practices Enforcement** - Azure Functions coding standards and deployment patterns
- ✅ **End-to-End Testing** - Validation of migrated functionality

### Chat Mode Features Used
- **Assessment Reports** - Comprehensive analysis of migration complexity
- **Code Generation** - Automated Azure Functions code with proper bindings
- **Infrastructure as Code** - Bicep templates following Azure Well-Architected Framework
- **Security Validation** - Managed identity configuration and RBAC setup
- **Deployment Automation** - Azure Developer CLI (azd) integration

## 🏗️ Architecture

The migrated solution maintains the same logical architecture while leveraging Azure-native services:

```
┌─────────────────┐    ┌──────────────────┐    ┌─────────────────┐
│   Image Upload  │    │   Event Grid     │    │ Storage Queue   │
│  (Blob Storage) │───▶│   (Blob Events)  │───▶│ (Processing)    │
└─────────────────┘    └──────────────────┘    └─────────────────┘
                                                          │
                                                          ▼
┌─────────────────┐    ┌──────────────────┐    ┌─────────────────┐
│ Processed Image │◀───│ Azure Functions  │───▶│ Computer Vision │
│ (Blob Storage)  │    │ (Face Blur Logic)│    │ (Face Detection)│
└─────────────────┘    └──────────────────┘    └─────────────────┘
```

## 🔐 Security & Best Practices

The migration implements enterprise-grade security:

- **🛡️ Managed Identity** - Zero secrets/connection strings in code
- **🔒 RBAC Permissions** - Principle of least privilege
- **🚫 Shared Key Disabled** - Storage account configured for managed identity only
- **📡 HTTPS Enforcement** - All communication encrypted
- **📊 Comprehensive Monitoring** - Application Insights integration

## 🚀 Deployment

### Prerequisites
- Azure CLI
- Azure Developer CLI (azd)
- Node.js 22+

### Quick Deploy
```bash
# Clone and deploy
git clone <this-repository>
cd MigrateLambdaToFunctions/azure-face-blur-function

# Authenticate and deploy
azd auth login
azd up
```

The deployment uses **Azure Developer CLI (azd)** which was configured as part of the migration process to provide:
- Infrastructure provisioning (Bicep templates)
- Application deployment
- Configuration management
- Environment variable setup
