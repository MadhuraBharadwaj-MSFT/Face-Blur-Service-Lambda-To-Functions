## Current Status

**Phase: Deployment Ready → Blocked by Terminal Issue**

✅ **All infrastructure and application code validated and ready for deployment!**

### 🎉 Deployment Readiness Achieved:
- ✅ **AZD Environment**: Configured `face-blur-dev` environment
- ✅ **Authentication**: Azure authentication verified
- ✅ **Subscription**: Microsoft Azure Internal Consumption selected
- ✅ **Configuration**: All environment variables set correctly
- ✅ **Infrastructure**: Bicep files validated and error-free
- ✅ **Application**: Azure Functions v4 code optimized

### 🚫 Current Blocker:
**Terminal Interactive Mode Issue**: The azd CLI is stuck in subscription selection mode despite proper configuration.

**Symptoms**:
```
? Select an Azure Subscription to use:
  Microsoft Azure Internal Consumption - MABHAR
  [Use arrows to move, type to filter]
```

**Impact**: Cannot proceed with automated `azd up` deployment.

### 🔧 Resolution Required:
Manual terminal interaction needed to select subscription or alternative deployment method.
