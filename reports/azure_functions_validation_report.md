**Findings:**
- âœ… Project correctly uses the v4 programming model
- âœ… Main entry point is `app.js` with proper `@azure/functions` import
- âœ… Functions are registered using `app.storageQueue()` pattern
- âœ… In-code bindings are properly implemented

**Code Example:**
```javascript
const { app } = require('@azure/functions');

app.storageQueue('blurFunction', {
    queueName: 'image-processing-queue',
    connection: 'AzureWebJobsStorage',
    handler: async (queueMessage, context) => {
        // Function implementation
    }
});
```

### âœ… Extension Bundles - PASS

**Requirement:** Prefer extension bundles over SDKs and use latest versions

**Findings:**
- âœ… Extension bundle is properly configured in `host.json`
- âœ… Uses the latest recommended version: `[4.*, 5.0.0)`
- âœ… Proper bundle ID: `Microsoft.Azure.Functions.ExtensionBundle`

### âœ… Function.json Files - PASS

**Requirement:** Avoid generating function.json files for v4 programming model

**Findings:**
- âœ… **RESOLVED:** Legacy `function.json` file has been removed

- âœ… Project structure is now clean and follows v4 best practices

**Action Taken:**
Removed the entire `src/blurFunction/` directory including the legacy `function.json` file.

### âœ… Local Settings - PASS

**Requirement:** Generate local.settings.json for local configuration

**Findings:**
- âœ… `local.settings.json` file exists and is properly configured
- âœ… Contains all necessary environment variables
- âœ… Proper runtime setting: `"FUNCTIONS_WORKER_RUNTIME": "node"`
- âœ… Development storage configuration included
- âœ… **IMPROVED:** Placeholder values are now clearly marked for replacement

### âœ… Host Configuration - PASS

**Requirement:** Ensure Function App is configured to use Functions Host v4

**Findings:**
- âœ… Host version correctly set to `"2.0"` (which supports v4 runtime)
- âœ… Application Insights properly configured
- âœ… Queue configuration optimized for the use case
- âœ… Logging configuration properly set up

### âœ… Dependencies - PASS

**Requirement:** Include required packages for v4 programming model

**Findings:**
- âœ… `@azure/functions` v4.0.0 is included
- âœ… All Azure SDK packages are up to date

- âœ… Package versions are compatible

### âœ… Project Structure - PASS

**Requirement:** Organize code into appropriate folders following best practices

**Findings:**
- âœ… Clean and organized project structure
- âœ… Proper separation of concerns with helper modules
- âœ… Main entry point clearly defined (`app.js`)
- âœ… Infrastructure code properly separated in `/infra` folder
- âœ… **CLEANED:** Removed legacy folders and files

**Final Project Structure:**
