---

## ✅ What We've Accomplished

### 📊 Complete Assessment & Analysis
- **AWS Lambda Assessment**: Comprehensive analysis with architecture diagrams
- **Migration Feasibility**: Detailed compatibility and effort analysis  
- **Service Mapping**: Direct AWS-to-Azure service translations identified

### 🔄 Successful Code Migration  
- **Azure Functions v4**: Fully migrated from AWS Lambda handlers
- **Node.js 22**: Latest runtime with optimized performance
- **Modular Architecture**: Clean separation of concerns (detectFaces, blurFaces)
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error management and logging

### 🏗️ Infrastructure Excellence
- **Azure Verified Modules (AVM)**: 100% compliance with latest standards
- **Security Best Practices**: Identity-based auth, TLS 1.2, no shared keys
- **Cost Optimization**: FlexConsumption (FC1) pricing model
- **Monitoring Stack**: Application Insights + Log Analytics configured
- **Network Security**: VNet integration and private endpoints ready

### 🔧 DevOps Automation
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Declarative Bicep templates
- **AZD Configuration**: Complete azure.yaml and environment setup
- **Deployment Ready**: One-command deployment capability

## 🚫 Current Blocker

**Issue**: AZD CLI stuck in interactive subscription selection mode

**Terminal State**:
```
? Select an Azure Subscription to use:
  Microsoft Azure Internal Consumption - MABHAR
  [Use arrows to move, type to filter]
```

**Impact**: Cannot complete automated deployment via `azd up`

---

## 🚀 Immediate Next Steps (Choose One)

### Option 1: Manual Terminal Resolution (Recommended)
```powershell
# 1. Open a fresh PowerShell terminal
# 2. Navigate to project
cd "c:\Users\mabhar\MigrateLambdaToFunctions\azure-face-blur-function"

# 3. Deploy with explicit environment
azd up --environment face-blur-dev

# 4. When prompted, select the subscription:
#    Microsoft Azure Internal Consumption - MABHAR
```

### Option 2: Azure CLI Direct Deployment
```powershell
# Deploy infrastructure directly
az deployment sub create \
  --location eastus \
  --template-file infra/main.bicep \
  --parameters infra/main.parameters.json \
  --parameters environmentName=face-blur-dev location=eastus

# Then deploy function code separately
func azure functionapp publish <function-app-name>
```

### Option 3: Portal-Based Deployment
1. Upload Bicep templates to Azure Portal
2. Deploy through Template Deployment service
3. Manually configure function app deployment

- [ ] Storage Account with containers (source, destination, queue)
- [ ] Computer Vision service operational
- [ ] Application Insights collecting telemetry
- [ ] Managed Identity configured with proper RBAC

### ✅ Functionality Test
- [ ] Upload test image to source container
- [ ] Verify face detection works
- [ ] Confirm face blur processing
- [ ] Check processed image in destination container
- [ ] Validate error handling scenarios

### ✅ Performance Validation  
- [ ] Function cold start times acceptable
- [ ] Image processing performance meets requirements
- [ ] Memory usage within expected limits
- [ ] Scaling behavior under load

## 🎯 Expected Deployment Results

Upon successful deployment, you'll have:

### 🏗️ Azure Resources Created
- **Resource Group**: `rg-face-blur-dev`
- **Function App**: `func-api-{uniqueToken}`
- **Storage Account**: `st{uniqueToken}` with containers
- **Computer Vision**: `cv-{uniqueToken}`
- **App Service Plan**: `asp-{uniqueToken}` (FC1)
- **Application Insights**: `appi-{uniqueToken}`
- **Log Analytics**: `log-{uniqueToken}`
- **Managed Identity**: `id-api-{uniqueToken}`

### 🔄 Processing Workflow
```
Image Upload → Blob Trigger → Face Detection → Face Blur → Processed Image
     ↓              ↓              ↓             ↓           ↓
Source Container → Function → Computer Vision → Function → Dest Container
```

### 💰 Cost Optimization
- **FlexConsumption**: Pay only for actual usage
- **Regional Deployment**: East US for optimal performance
- **Resource Efficiency**: Right-sized components
