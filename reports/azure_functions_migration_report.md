# Azure Functions Migration Report

## Migration Overview

This report documents the migration process from AWS Lambda to Azure Functions for the face blur service application. The migration involved converting the serverless application that automatically blurs faces in uploaded images, maintaining the same functionality while adapting to Azure's services and architecture.

## Migration Strategy

The migration followed a lift-and-shift approach with necessary adaptations for Azure-specific services:

1. **Code Migration**: Restructured the Lambda function code to align with Azure Functions programming model
2. **Service Mapping**: Mapped AWS services to equivalent Azure services
3. **Infrastructure as Code**: Converted CloudFormation templates to Azure Bicep
4. **Configuration**: Updated environment variables and connection settings
5. **Testing**: Created test files compatible with Azure Functions

## Service Mapping

| AWS Service | Azure Service | Notes |
|-------------|---------------|-------|
| AWS Lambda | Azure Functions | Node.js runtime, queue-triggered function |
| Amazon S3 | Azure Blob Storage | Source and destination containers for images |
| Amazon SQS | Azure Storage Queue | Queue for new image events |
| Amazon Rekognition | Azure Computer Vision | Face detection capabilities |
| AWS IAM | Azure RBAC | Managed Identity with role assignments |
| AWS CloudFormation | Azure Bicep | Infrastructure as Code |

## Code Changes

### Major Changes

1. **Function Trigger**: Changed from SQS to Azure Storage Queue trigger
2. **Authentication**: Replaced AWS SDK authentication with Azure DefaultAzureCredential
3. **Face Detection**: Switched from Amazon Rekognition to Azure Computer Vision
4. **Blob Storage**: Implemented Azure Blob Storage SDK for image retrieval and storage
5. **Error Handling**: Updated error handling patterns for Azure services

### File Structure Changes

| AWS Lambda Structure | Azure Functions Structure |
|----------------------|---------------------------|
| src/app.js | src/blurFunction/index.js |
| src/detectFaces.js | src/detectFaces.js (updated) |
| src/blurFaces.js | src/blurFaces.js (updated) |
| template.yaml | infra/main.bicep + modules |
| N/A | src/function.json (binding configuration) |

## Infrastructure as Code Changes

The CloudFormation template was migrated to Azure Bicep with the following structure:

- **main.bicep**: Main deployment file with resource orchestration
- **modules/function.bicep**: Function App and App Service Plan
- **modules/storage.bicep**: Storage Account, containers, and queue
- **modules/computerVision.bicep**: Computer Vision service
- **modules/rbac.bicep**: Role-based access control assignments

## Configuration Changes

Environment variables were updated to Azure equivalents:

| AWS Lambda | Azure Functions |
|------------|----------------|
| AWS_REGION | N/A (handled by Azure SDK) |
| DestinationBucketName | DESTINATION_CONTAINER_NAME |
| N/A | STORAGE_ACCOUNT_URL |
| N/A | SOURCE_CONTAINER_NAME |
| N/A | COMPUTER_VISION_ENDPOINT |
| N/A | COMPUTER_VISION_KEY (optional) |

## Testing Approach

Testing was updated to work with Azure Functions:

1. Created mock implementations for Azure SDKs
2. Updated test event structure to match Azure Queue trigger format
3. Maintained the same test workflow and validation logic

## Challenges and Solutions

| Challenge | Solution |
|-----------|----------|
| Different function trigger model | Updated code to handle Azure Storage Queue messages |
| Authentication differences | Implemented DefaultAzureCredential for Azure services |
| Face detection API differences | Adapted Computer Vision response format to match original code expectations |
| IAM to RBAC mapping | Created user-assigned managed identity with appropriate role assignments |
| Image processing dependencies | Maintained GraphicsMagick usage with updated integration |

## Performance Considerations

- Azure Computer Vision may have different latency characteristics than Amazon Rekognition
- Storage access patterns were optimized for Azure Blob Storage
- Function configuration (memory, timeout) was adjusted for Azure environment
- Scale settings were configured for expected workload

## Security Considerations

- Implemented Azure Managed Identity for secure authentication
- Used role-based access control for least privilege
- Configured secure storage access
- Enabled HTTPS-only access
- Deployed Application Insights for monitoring

## Cost Considerations

- Azure Functions consumption plan for cost-efficient serverless execution
- Standard tier Computer Vision service based on expected usage
- Storage account with Hot tier for active image processing
- Cost optimization recommendations included in documentation

## Next Steps

1. **Performance Testing**: Conduct load testing to validate performance in Azure
2. **Monitoring Setup**: Configure alerts and dashboards in Application Insights
3. **CI/CD Pipeline**: Implement automated deployment pipeline
4. **Disaster Recovery**: Establish backup and recovery procedures
5. **Documentation**: Update operational documentation for Azure environment

## Conclusion

The migration from AWS Lambda to Azure Functions was successfully completed, maintaining the core functionality while adapting to Azure's services and best practices. The application now leverages Azure's serverless capabilities, managed identity for security, and Azure Computer Vision for face detection.

The architecture was designed to be scalable, secure, and cost-efficient, following Azure best practices for serverless applications.
